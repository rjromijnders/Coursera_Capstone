## Introduction
AMSTERDAM COFFEE wants to open a new coffee shop somewhere in Toronto, Canada. However, for it to be profitable they want to explore which neighborhood would be most suitable. Therefor the aim of this project is to find the best neighborhood for a new coffee shop.

We try to answer the following research question:
> What neighborhood is most suitable for opening a new coffee shop?

The best neighborhood for opening a new coffeeshop is defined as any Toronto neighborhood where the occurence of coffee shops is not in the top three venues.
